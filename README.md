# IL22-Multi-cytokine-models
Biological Activity of Microbe-Produced IL-22 in a Human Germ-Free Gut Model

Characterizing the biological effects of the bacterial produced cytokine compared to the pure cytokine is essential in assessing the potential translational value of an IL-22 secreting microbial therapeutic. To this end, we co-cultured Caco2 and HT-29 colo rectal cancer cells on transwell inserts to create a germ-free intestinal epithelium model.
This germ-free transwell model mimics critical aspects of the human intestine, such astight junctions' expression, mucins' production, and cytokine mediators. Using this platform, we assessed the comparative effects of pure IL-22 and microbe-produced IL-22 and associated microbial products on modulating intestinal epithelial cytokine responses in the presence of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory stimulus.

The germ-free gut model was challenged by 10 uM and 100 uM of LPS alone and in combination with 1ng/mL of mouse IL-22 and 1ng/mL of our microbe-produced
IL-22, here termed "GE-IL-22"for (GE: genetically engineered). We profiled cytokine secretion by the gut model using a 27-plex cytokine assay on a BioPlex-3D Luminex system. To identify those cytokine signals most strongly associated with the inflammatory stimulus (LPS) and anti-inflammatory therapeutic (IL-22 or GE-IL-22) we constructed two Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models,one for the GE-IL-22 conditions and one for the pure
IL-22 stimulation controls, to relate cytokine concentrations (X-block) to a 2-dimensional Y-block consisting of LPS concentration [0ng, 10ng, 100ng] and
IL-22 treatment status [0,1]. The cytokines most predictive of inflammatory stimulus and IL-22 treatment were identified via variable importance of projection (VIP) score analysis and analysis of cytokine loading coefficients.
